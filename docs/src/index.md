# ClusteredLowRankSolver.jl

[`ClusteredLowRankSolver.jl`](https://github.com/nanleij/ClusteredLowRankSolver.jl) provides a primal-dual interior point method for solving clustered low-rank semidefinite programs. This can be used for (semidefinite) programs with polynomial inequality constraints, which can be rewritten in terms of sum-of-squares polynomials. See the [manual]() for a more detailed description of the problems and the usage of the solver.
